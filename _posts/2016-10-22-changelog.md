Yesterday From released Patch 1.08 in preparation for the Ashes of Ariandel release. I did some data mining to determine the stat changes. It appears the only change was to poise values on armor, which have been updated on the site. [See this Reddit post for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/58nl84/patch_108_data_mining_results_no_new_ars_poise/).

I also fixed a bug that was present on Safari iOS. If you selected a new starting class and then tried to select a weapon it would switch back to the starting class dropdown instead.
