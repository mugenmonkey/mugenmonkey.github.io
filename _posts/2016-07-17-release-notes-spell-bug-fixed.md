title: "DS3 Planner Release notes: Spell Bug Fixed"

A bugfix was pushed up for the DS3 planner this morning. This resolves an issue where equipping spells
and then reducing attunement would prevent you from re-assigning spells, and would show an incorrect
value in the "Slots" indicator.

Spells have been one of the trickier parts of the planner to build, so I'm hoping to improve them
more in the future. I'd like to better indicate what spells you can equip, what spells you don't have
the stats for, and perhaps some indication of their damage. If there's anything with spells that would
make your life easier, go ahead and leave a comment.
