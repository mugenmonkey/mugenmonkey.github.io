I've taken to posting all changelog messages here instead of on the frontpage of Mugenmonkey. This will allow me to remodel the frontpage to be a bit more helpful. Since I didn't want to just throw away all of those old announcements and changelog messages, I'll be adding them to this post for posterity.

## Old Announcements

# July 19th, 2016

Future announcments and changelogs will now be posted on my my blog. All changes will be posted there, and not here. Eventually this page will be replaced with something more useful.

# June 12th, 2016

Infusions have been added to the Dark Souls 3 planner! This would not have been possible without the amazing work monrandria and pireax did in mining out all of the infusion and scaling data. Check out there spreadsheet here.

# May 4th, 2016

The first version of AR calculation for the DS3 planner has been released. Very big thanks to Trogggg for discovering most of the scaling modifiers!

Take a look at his standalone AR calculator!

# April 30th, 2016

Dark Souls 3 Character Planner has been released! Please see this Reddit post for some detailed info on the release.

# November 23rd, 2015

The Old Hunters DLC is releasing tonight! In preparation for that, I've added all of the new weapons, armor and runes to the Bloodborne planner. You may want to avoid using the BB planner if you want to avoid spoilers for now.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The stats are not accurate for the new equipment yet. I will update them throughout the week as we get improved info.

# April 28th, 2015

Comments have been re-enabled for now. However, you now have the ability to prevent comments on your build when you create it (there is a "Allow comments?" checkbox). I do not really have time to moderate the comments section, so if you wish to avoid possible spam or trolling on your build entirely, do not allow comments.

# April 22nd, 2015

Bloodborne Planner has been released! Check out this Reddit post for more info.

# April 2nd, 2015

Due to the prevalance of trolling and spam in the comments, they have been disabled for now. Moderating them is a bit difficult, so I will be looking into a better solution for commenting in the future.

# January 31st, 2015

Huge updates, as you can see! Before anybody panics about changes they see, please at least skim this:

There have been some major backend updates that required a huge database migration. All accounts, builds, and comments should be migrated. However, if you seem to be missing something please let me know.
The Dark Souls 1 planner has been left unchanged. Everything should work there exactly as you remember it. The build browsing and rating may be a bit different, but the planner itself is the same.
The Dark Souls 2 planner should work fine, but is a Work in Progress. Certain features may be missing and certain calculations may be off or broken. I'm aware, and it will continue to get better.
The Dark Souls 2 planner does not currently calculate Weapon AR. This will likely be added sometime after Scholar of the First Sin. There wasn't much of a point in adding it now, as SotFS is likely to rebalance a lot of weapons.
That being said, I hope you all enjoy the Dark Souls 2 and Demon's Souls planners. The Demon's Soul planner was created entirely by Nigh7H4wk, who was nice enough to be willing to let me host it on Mugenmonkey. The styling on the Dark Souls 2 planner is also thanks to him.

You can save your Demon's and Dark Souls 2 builds to your original Mugenmonkey accounts (which should all still work).

The Dark Souls 2 planner has some sweet fashion-souls.com integration now. That site was created by citiral, and is great, so check it out! When you create a build, it will autogenerate the URL to access a Fashion Souls link that matches your current build's armor. See if you can beat my Fashion!

- Tons of updates (as you can see!)

- The scoring used for "Top Builds" is a little different. I am going to keep tweaking it.
- Builds created by non-registered users will no longer have a linkable view. The reasoning is that previously anybody could claim they were somebody (i.e., "OroboroTheNinja") while creating a build, and there would be a list of builds that appeared to incorrectly belong to that person.
