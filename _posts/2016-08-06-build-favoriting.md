Today I re-introduced build favoriting. This used to work with Dark Souls 1, but was removed at some point. I've added it back, as well as enabled it for all build types (DS1, DS2, DS3, BB, DES)! This should be a handy way of keeping track of cool builds that you find.

To view all of your favorites login (or [register](https://mugenmonkey.com/users/sign_up)) and head over to [https://mugenmonkey.com/favorites](https://mugenmonkey.com/favorites). From there you can view (and optionally remove) all of your favorites for all of the games. This even has the handy searching and filtering options that the main browser has (which could be useful if you store a bunch of favorites).

To favorite, just look for the little star that'll appear next to build titles while you're logged in.

You can also favorite directly from the [build browsers](https://mugenmonkey.com/darksouls3/browse).
