Oh, hi there! I've been considering putting together a Mugenmonkey blog for awhile now. So I did it.

You can expect release notes, talks about future plans, and other announcements to show up here.
This should hopefully be a better platform than Twitter, or whatever other random places I typically
post Mugenmonkey related things on.

I also ocassionaly want to ramble about something, so this is a good spot for me to dump
those (likely inane) thoughts where they can safely be ignored by the internet at large.
