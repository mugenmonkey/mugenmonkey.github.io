# Today I released the following updates:

* Updated AR calculations to reflect Regulation 1.09.

This mainly affects certain weapons that now receive physical bonuses from Faith scaling (Wolnir's, Lothric's, and Morne's).
There were also a few nerfs (Anri's sword, for example). A more thorough examination of the changes in Regulation 1.09
can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4qqtpi/app_105_regulation_109_changes_megathread/).

The values were mined out of the game's datafiles, so they *should* be accurate. However, it's possible
something might have been inputted wrong, so if you see any problems let me know! (You can do so
by [filling out this form](http://goo.gl/forms/bLUkmMau5U), yelling at me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mugenmonkey),
or leaving a comment on this post.)

As an aside, AR is pretty complicated in DS3 (as is the method by which you have to extract scaling modifiers).
I'm considering writing a blog post outlining the whole process and formula -- if that interests you,
leave a comment!

* Fixed a bug causing AR to not be reset on weapon change unless you switched infusions

This bug was caused by another bugfix I released earlier this week...don't hate, code is tricky. :O

As an addendum, this is my first time writing up release notes on this blog. I plan to continue to do this -
I'm able to go into more depth then I would on Twitter, and I'm fairly sure nobody ever looks at
the changelog that I have on the main page of Mugenmonkey. Since I'd like to replace all of that
with more helpful information, it seemed like a good idea to start shoving these here (both for
visibility and posterity!).
