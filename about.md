This blog will primarily serve the following purposes:

- Provide a better platform than Twitter for announcements and release notes for Mugenmonkey
- Somewhere to post interesting technical things I write or discover while working on Mugenmonkey
- A place for me to ramble about random things (which will probably be mostly about Mugenmonkey - but no promises)
